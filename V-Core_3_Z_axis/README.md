# V-Core 3 Z axis for the Ender-5

This mod is a recreation from scratch of the V-Core 3 Z axis motion system. That's necessary because the Ratrig's printer uses 3030 aluminum profiles for the frame, while the Ender-5 uses 2020 and 2040 aluminum profiles.

##Updates:
May 05th, 2021: Initial upload. Included are the files for the motor mounts, and the DXF for two different bed designs and an adapter for those who already have a thirdy-party bed (or want to reuse the stock one). All these files still needs to be validated.
