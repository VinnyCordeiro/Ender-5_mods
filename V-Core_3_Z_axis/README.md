# V-Core 3 Z axis for the Ender-5

This mod is a recreation from scratch of the V-Core 3 Z axis motion system. That's necessary because the Ratrig's printer uses 3030 aluminum profiles for the frame, while the Ender-5 uses 2020 and 2040 aluminum profiles.

To install the mod, follow the build instructions for the [Z motor mounts](https://ratrig.dozuki.com/Guide/04.+Z+motor+mounts/71?lang=en) and the [bed assembly](https://ratrig.dozuki.com/Guide/07.+Bed+Assembly/77?lang=en), following the same procedures. The only difference is that I designed the motor mounts to be fixed with M5 screws and nuts, instead of M6.

### To-Do
- Include a BOM list, with links for the vitamins that need to be used.

## Updates:
May 05th, 2021: Initial upload. Included are the files for the motor mounts, and the DXF for two different bed designs and an adapter for those who already have a thirdy-party bed (or want to reuse the stock one). All these files still needs to be validated.
